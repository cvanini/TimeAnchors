## Overview 
This repository contains a collection of sample artifacts extracted from 4 disk images, which have been analyzed and discussed in a paper accepted to DFRWS USA 24. These artifacts serve as a practical reference to the theoretical concepts and methodologies presented in our work. 

This is a temporary location, the content of this repository will shortly be moved to a SwissUBase repository.
